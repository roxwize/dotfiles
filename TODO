[x] Get PulseAudio sound controls on polybar to work
[x] Add desktop switching to windows (context menu?)
[x] Decide on an icon theme (flat-remix-icon-theme or pantheon.elementary-icon-theme?)
[x] Use XDG???
[x] Add Mousepad (xfce) maybe
[ ] Make setting your wallpaper like. Global across everything because you
 |  do it with hsetroot on Openbox startup but not anywhere else (minus
 |  changing it with dconf)
 +- [ ] Stylix may help with this
[ ] Replace absolute paths (i.e. in openbox autostart file) with substituted
    paths generated by Nix (see substituteAllInPlace)
[x] Consider using flakes
[x] Use just?
[x] Are you managing package overlays properly (check home.nix FIXME and https://nixos-and-flakes.thiscute.world/nixpkgs/overlays)
 +- [x] Just put it in your base.nix config and see if it comes across to home
 |      manager or if you have to import it into both
 +- [ ] https://github.com/notusknot/dotfiles-nix/blob/a034dcb6daff31ce50cdbc74a5972b1ef56ef3d7/overlays/apple-color-emoji.nix
[ ] Use pass <https://www.passwordstore.org/>? (See also https://elvishjerricco.github.io/2018/06/24/secure-declarative-key-management.html)
[x] Figure out e16...not even sure if managing your themes the way you currently are is even slightly ideal...
[ ] You could try making a GTK4 application that lets you manage/view packages in packages.nix
[ ] Get Rust to work (rustc + cargo is fine but only rustup provides RLS, but, um,)
 +- [ ] vimPlugins.coc-rls
 +- [x] Get rust-analyzer binaries from https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-analyzer
 +- [ ] rust-analyzer doesn't fucking work (and you should probably use mkShell for this)
[x] See if you can use nixpkgs vscode extensions with codium
[ ] Get language servers to work with Neovim
[ ] Theme your SDDM (you should make one yourself ;w;;;)
[ ] Maybe convert some of your configuration files and themes into derivations
[x] Add polybar root filesystem usage module??
[ ] Test out bluetooth (https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Bluetooth)
[ ] Get a music player + get MPD to work (+last.fm with mpdscribble)
[x] Give yambar a try ;w;
[ ] Dig polybar's grave (you're not using it anymore so why keep it around?)
