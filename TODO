[ ] you should really look over your neovim config because i dont think you understand or even wrote half of it besides the neotree part

== old stuff

[ ] Make setting your wallpaper like. Global across everything because you
 |  do it with hsetroot on Openbox startup but not anywhere else (minus
 |  changing it with dconf)
 +- [ ] Stylix may help with this
[ ] Replace absolute paths (i.e. in openbox autostart file) with substituted
    paths generated by Nix (see substituteAllInPlace)
[x] Are you managing package overlays properly (check home.nix FIXME and https://nixos-and-flakes.thiscute.world/nixpkgs/overlays)
 +- [x] Just put it in your base.nix config and see if it comes across to home
 |      manager or if you have to import it into both
 +- [ ] https://github.com/notusknot/dotfiles-nix/blob/a034dcb6daff31ce50cdbc74a5972b1ef56ef3d7/overlays/apple-color-emoji.nix
[ ] You could try making a GTK4 application that lets you manage/view packages in packages.nix
[ ] Theme your SDDM (you should make one yourself ;w;;;)
[ ] Maybe convert some of your configuration files and themes into derivations
[x] Get a music player + get MPD to work
 +- [ ] +last.fm with mpdscribble
[ ] Get a pager/systray <https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Openbox/Guide#Pagers_and_systrays>
[ ] Host-dependent home configurations (e.g. don't assume MPD music is in `/mnt/world/music` for every machine)
 +- [ ] Maybe symlink your music to a music folder in your home directory or something (i.e. `~/Music -> /mnt/world/music` or perhaps a subdirectory of that?)
[ ] alvr doesnt work :(
[ ] Using clangd and gcc ??? Also clang-tools is atrociously big
[ ] Try getting `ultram4rine.vscode-choosealicense` (either locally via overlays and `buildVscodeMarketplaceExtension` or via <https://github.com/nix-community/nix-vscode-extensions>)
[x] Add openbox keybinds for defocusing/focusing + cycling windows and maybe swapping workspaces
 +- [ ] Click to focus doesnt work unless its on the titlebar for some reason
 +- [ ] Using shift instead of ctrl seems inconsistent but it appears that other applications use ctrl+alt+arrowkeys for their own purposes which IDK if i want to overwrite
[ ] Fix alt+tab switcher fonts and colors being fucked up
[ ] Get fishline
 +- [ ] i dont think fish.plugins works for this
[ ] Get minecraft assets to work PLEAAASEEEEE
[ ] Make cavestory multiplayer into a nix derivation (its a zip file, see https://discourse.nixos.org/t/what-is-your-approach-to-packaging-wine-applications-with-nix-derivations/12799)
[ ] MEGA TODO: get timeshift.json to work (its in /etc/timeshift/timeshift.json so i think itll need its own derivation)
[ ] soteria doesnt fucking work
[ ] make https://github.com/addy-dclxvi/openbox-theme-collections.git into a derivation????
 +- [ ] numix-clone + vermello
[ ] YNFG derivations
[ ] MEGA MEGA TODO: Get your custom cursor to work :((((( It was working on the vm???
[x] Personally i think your desktop fucking sucks and you should just switch to kde plasma (Edit: no)
 +- [ ] Just see if you can write a yambar plugin that gives you a taskbar...........
[ ] Should you be using both libretro easyrpg and standalone easyrpg at the same time like you are now ????????
[ ] FUN IDEA 2::: Hey Whats Up what if you did the same thing but built your regular host (ioides) as an ISO so that like. hoooly shit. you could like share it to the woRLD VIA AN ISO AND SHTUFF. Fucking massive bro
[x] IMPORTANT!!!!: consolidate most system configurations since there seems to be the assumption that Everything Is Ioides (i.e. move packages.nix to ioides/)
 +- [ ] Make things consolidated wherever possible, only generalize them/widen their scope once it becomes necessary (like when you turned part of base.nix into desktop.nix) (e.g. when you need to manage something identically across hosts, put it in an import file, otherwise put it in an attrset that both hosts import and configure it from there)
 +- [x] Just do thaatttt . Make som fucken modules
[ ] Consider removing some of your packages Idk

[x] Get PulseAudio sound controls on polybar to work
[x] Add desktop switching to windows (context menu?)
[x] Decide on an icon theme (flat-remix-icon-theme or pantheon.elementary-icon-theme?)
[x] Use XDG???
[x] Add Mousepad (xfce) maybe
[x] Consider using flakes
[x] Use just?
[x] Figure out e16...not even sure if managing your themes the way you currently are is even slightly ideal...
[x] See if you can use nixpkgs vscode extensions with codium
[x] Get language servers to work with Neovim
[x] Add polybar root filesystem usage module??
[x] Give yambar a try ;w;
[x] Fix yambar being offset on your screen for some reason (might have to file an issue on its repo)
[x] rmpc isnt working WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAaa ive been working on this for a month i just wanna be done so i can lie down and cuddle girls and be happy forever................
[x] Manage flatpaks declaratively (https://github.com/gmodena/nix-flatpak)
[x] Download Slack !!NOW WWWW!!!!FUCKKKK
[x] Get MPC to work with yambar (having to use playerctl mpris bridge shit at the moment which doesn't work very well x_x)
[x] Get Rust to work (rustc + cargo is fine but only rustup provides RLS, but, um,)
 +- [x] vimPlugins.coc-rls
 +- [x] Get rust-analyzer binaries from https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-analyzer
 +- [x] rust-analyzer doesn't fucking work (and you should probably use mkShell for this)
 +- [x] All of a sudden Nix won't let you run rustc or cargo due to some dynamically linked executable bullshit
[x] Use pass <https://www.passwordstore.org/>? (See also https://elvishjerricco.github.io/2018/06/24/secure-declarative-key-management.html)
[x] switch to 24 hour time
[x] FUN IDEA::: Do you see ? https://github.com/nix-community/raspberry-pi-nix/blob/master/rpi/default.nix ??? see if it might be worth trying to make an options set across your config for very non granular at a glance configurations ... (see also https://github.com/nanzhong/env/blob/master/machines/devpi/configuration.nix)
[x] Switch over to using tabs for indents
[x] music tagging - ex falso or kid3???
[x] Test out bluetooth (https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Bluetooth)
[x] Dig polybar's grave (you're not using it anymore so why keep it around?)
