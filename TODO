[ ] Make setting your wallpaper like. Global across everything because you
 |  do it with hsetroot on Openbox startup but not anywhere else (minus
 |  changing it with dconf)
 +- [ ] Stylix may help with this
[ ] Replace absolute paths (i.e. in openbox autostart file) with substituted
    paths generated by Nix (see substituteAllInPlace)
[x] Are you managing package overlays properly (check home.nix FIXME and https://nixos-and-flakes.thiscute.world/nixpkgs/overlays)
 +- [x] Just put it in your base.nix config and see if it comes across to home
 |      manager or if you have to import it into both
 +- [ ] https://github.com/notusknot/dotfiles-nix/blob/a034dcb6daff31ce50cdbc74a5972b1ef56ef3d7/overlays/apple-color-emoji.nix
[ ] Use pass <https://www.passwordstore.org/>? (See also https://elvishjerricco.github.io/2018/06/24/secure-declarative-key-management.html)
[ ] You could try making a GTK4 application that lets you manage/view packages in packages.nix
[x] Get Rust to work (rustc + cargo is fine but only rustup provides RLS, but, um,)
 +- [ ] vimPlugins.coc-rls
 +- [x] Get rust-analyzer binaries from https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-analyzer
 +- [x] rust-analyzer doesn't fucking work (and you should probably use mkShell for this)
 +- [x] All of a sudden Nix won't let you run rustc or cargo due to some dynamically linked executable bullshit
[ ] Theme your SDDM (you should make one yourself ;w;;;)
[ ] Maybe convert some of your configuration files and themes into derivations
[ ] Test out bluetooth (https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Bluetooth)
[x] Get a music player + get MPD to work
 +- [ ] +last.fm with mpdscribble
[ ] Dig polybar's grave (you're not using it anymore so why keep it around?)
[ ] Get a pager/systray <https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Openbox/Guide#Pagers_and_systrays>
[ ] Host-dependent home configurations (e.g. don't assume MPD music is in `/mnt/world/music` for every machine)
 +- [ ] Maybe symlink your music to a music folder in your home directory or something (i.e. `~/Music -> /mnt/world/music` or perhaps a subdirectory of that?)
[ ] alvr doesnt work :(
[ ] Using clangd and gcc ??? Also clang-tools is atrociously big
[ ] Try getting `ultram4rine.vscode-choosealicense` (either locally via overlays and `buildVscodeMarketplaceExtension` or via <https://github.com/nix-community/nix-vscode-extensions>)
[x] Add openbox keybinds for defocusing/focusing + cycling windows and maybe swapping workspaces
 +- [ ] Click to focus doesnt work unless its on the titlebar for some reason
 +- [ ] Using shift instead of ctrl seems inconsistent but it appears that other applications use ctrl+alt+arrowkeys for their own purposes which IDK if i want to overwrite
[ ] Fix alt+tab switcher fonts and colors being fucked up
[ ] Get fishline

[x] Get PulseAudio sound controls on polybar to work
[x] Add desktop switching to windows (context menu?)
[x] Decide on an icon theme (flat-remix-icon-theme or pantheon.elementary-icon-theme?)
[x] Use XDG???
[x] Add Mousepad (xfce) maybe
[x] Consider using flakes
[x] Use just?
[x] Figure out e16...not even sure if managing your themes the way you currently are is even slightly ideal...
[x] See if you can use nixpkgs vscode extensions with codium
[x] Get language servers to work with Neovim
[x] Add polybar root filesystem usage module??
[x] Give yambar a try ;w;
[x] Fix yambar being offset on your screen for some reason (might have to file an issue on its repo)
[x] rmpc isnt working WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAaa ive been working on this for a month i just wanna be done so i can lie down and cuddle girls and be happy forever................
[x] Manage flatpaks declaratively (https://github.com/gmodena/nix-flatpak)
[x] Download Slack !!NOW WWWW!!!!FUCKKKK
[x] Get MPC to work with yambar (having to use playerctl mpris bridge shit at the moment which doesn't work very well x_x)
