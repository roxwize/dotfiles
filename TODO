[x] Add desktop switching to windows (context menu?)
[ ] Decide on an icon theme (flat-remix-icon-theme or pantheon.elementary-icon-theme?)
[ ] Use XDG???
[x] Add Mousepad (xfce) maybe
[ ] Make setting your wallpaper like. Global across everything because you
 |  do it with hsetroot on Openbox startup but not anywhere else (minus

 |  paths generated by Nix (see substituteAllInPlace)
[x] Consider using flakes
[x] Use just?
[ ] Are you managing package overlays properly (check home.nix FIXME and https://nixos-and-flakes.thiscute.world/nixpkgs/overlays)
 +- [ ] Just put it in your base.nix config and see if it comes across to home
     |  manager or if you have to import it into both
